Rest periods of short duration, usually 20 minutes or less, are common in industry and are customarily paid for as working time. These short periods must be counted as hours worked. Bona fide meal periods (typically 30 minutes or more) generally need not be compensated as work time. The employee must be completely relieved from duty for the purpose of eating regular meals.

For purposes of this D O L-Timesheet, all break time will be deducted from your total hours of work.  For questions regarding proper deductions for break time, please call the Wage and Hour Division at <a href="tel:1-866-487-9243">1&middot;866&middot;487&middot;9243</a>.
