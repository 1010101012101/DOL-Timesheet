<p>
This application is designed as a reference tool for employees. It does not include every possible situation encountered in the workplace. Some situations not addressed in this Advisor may yield a different result in the calculation of total pay. These include, but are not limited to, situations where, for example, the employee is not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act or is exempt from the minimum wage and/or overtime pay requirements of the FLSA.
</p>
<p>
The existence of certain agreements concerning the payment of overtime will also affect the overtime calculation, for example agreements to pay overtime based on one and one-half times the rate in effect for the type of work performed; or based on an established basic rate; or based on a guaranteed amount where the employee's hours, including non-overtime hours, are irregular.
</p>
<p>
For information about these situations, or to discuss other questions you may have concerning overtime pay requirements, contact your <a href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm">local Wage and Hour Division office</a>.
